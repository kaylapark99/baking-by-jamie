# baking-by-jamie
Baking Portfolio site for my hardworking and talented mom! 

Single page static site utilizing HTML/CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap. 
Implemented responsive design across all devices. 

In the future, I will hopefully continue to expand this project by adding more detail/prices for each baked good. Hover over a photo to reveal ingredients, quantity, and pricing for the specific baked good. Add a form to submit orders directly to my mother so that "mock" purchases can be made through the website.
